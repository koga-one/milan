Dealing with some paperwork from Georgia Tech! Technical difficulties, thankfully nothing serious. Having a good mentor to help you out goes a long way...

Ah, I also got my new phone / accessories (screen protector and case, as well as a power bank). It is amazing how fast tech has been progressing! Few years ago, a cellphone with 120Hz screen, 4000mAh battery and quad-camera setup would be amazingly expensive.
