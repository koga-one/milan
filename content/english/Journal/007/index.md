Another day, another drawing. Today I finally woke up at the right time! Unfortunately this drawing didn't reach my expectations, but hey... I draw everyday! Some of the drawings won't be that good, it's alright. All that matters is that I keep going

<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
    {{< imgproc path="images/006.png" method="Fill" size="400x500" col="12" >}}
