***#021***

I'm having a meeting with my fellow brazilian GT freshmen (and women) in 30min! It'll be very fun getting to know them for the first time. Talking about that, I also have to decide who's going to be my roommate. Should I just go random?

<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
    {{< imgproc path="images/gt.jpeg" method="Fill" size="320x180" col="12" >}}
</div>
