###### Observations

##### Format

Well, this is my first week entry. I don't know how the format should be, but I don't care: let's just see what works!

##### Site Changes

I've been slowly improving some things on the website that you might've noticed. The major one is the Table of Contents; right on this page, you can see it on the right side of the page ==>

It helps the reader to see the content of a page *duh*, while still maintaining the visual style of my website. It's important to note, however, that I still haven't finished it!

###### Simplicity

Here are some quotes that talk about the art of simplicity. As a human that likes to complicate things, organize things, and more, I really appreciate these quotes, as they directly confront my unfortunate *addiction* of defining unnecessary structures and patterns where there are none. To be honest, I **am** a pattern-seeker. I enjoy order and predictability. On the other hand, however, structure demands some compromises, and those compromises shouldn't be more energy-wasting than the things you're trying to structure. Ironically, I always get to the point that these rules and structures I define for myself end up getting in the way of my true tasks.

I'm really trying to improve on that.

> I truly believe that simplicity together with unfathomable persistence is enough to reach any objective.

Anyways, here are the quotes:
