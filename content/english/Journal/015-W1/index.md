###### Initial Notes

##### Format

Well, this is my first week entry. I don't know how the format should be, but I don't care: let's just see what works!

##### Site Changes

I've been slowly improving some things on the website that you might've noticed. The major one is the Table of Contents; right on this page, you can see it on the right side of the page ==>

It helps the reader to see the content of a page *duh*, while still maintaining the visual style of my website. It's important to note, however, that I still haven't finished it!

###### Updates

Here are the things that have happened recently

##### Hospital Night

Some days ago I had to go to the Albert Einstein hospital (yes, this is the hospital's name) to perform a polysomnography to check if my sleep is alright, as I've had multiple weird problems recently. Things such as lack of energy, restlessness while sleeping, and some other stuff. Even though the exam showed no weird results, I quite "enjoyed the experience" (wouldn't like to repeat it so soon though). The staff definitely helped improving the experience. The nurse was very friendly, chatting with me about all kinds of things (astrology, mostly) while setting up the electrodes. At the end I also had the chance of getting a Frapuccino, so I'd say *worth it*.

##### New Phone

After spending quite A LOT of time searching for the best phone to buy (because I'm soon going to USA, and my current cellphone isn't compatible with their internet bands), I decided to buy the Samsung S20 FE. It isn't expensive, has a great set of cameras, and an overall impressive quality. Trust me, I spent way more time searching than I'd like to admit.

##### Game Launched

I launched a game on [Itchio](https://bykoga.itch.io/almost-tic-tac-toe) and [Google Play (not yet approved)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.by.koga.almosttictactoe)

It is called ***(almost) tic-tac-toe*** and it is a simple yet very polished and fun game. Basically, you play tic-tac-toe 1v1 by tapping the screen at the right time, choosing where the X's and O's should land. I'm very proud of the game, and guess what: you can even play it here!

##### Rebranding

I changed some brand stuff!

<div class="row d-flex" data-masonry='{"percentPosition": true }'>
    <div class="col-1"></div>
    {{< imgproc path="images/wp2.png" method="Fill" size="512x128" col="12" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/icon.png" method="Fill" size="512x512" col="6" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/pink.png" method="Fill" size="410x230" col="6" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/wp.png" method="Fill" size="410x230" col="6" >}}
</div>

<br>

Here are the new assets I've created, here are the things for my game as well:

<div class="row d-flex" data-masonry='{"percentPosition": true }'>
    <div class="col-1"></div>
    {{< imgproc path="images/ttt.png" method="Fit" size="512x512" col="6" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/s1.jpg" method="Fit" size="432x216" col="6" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/s2.jpg" method="Fit" size="432x216" col="6" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/s3.jpg" method="Fit" size="432x216" col="6" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/s4.jpg" method="Fit" size="432x216" col="6" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/s5.jpg" method="Fit" size="432x216" col="6" >}}
    {{< imgproc path="images/tttbanner.png" method="Fit" size="432x216" col="6" >}}
</div>

###### Simplicity

Here are some quotes that talk about the art of simplicity. As a human that likes to complicate things, organize things, and more, I really appreciate these quotes, as they directly confront my unfortunate *addiction* of defining unnecessary structures and patterns where there are none. To be honest, I **am** a pattern-seeker. I enjoy order and predictability. On the other hand, however, structure demands some compromises, and those compromises shouldn't be more energy-wasting than the things you're trying to structure. Ironically, I always get to the point that these rules and structures I define for myself end up getting in the way of my true tasks.

I'm really trying to improve on that.

> I truly believe that simplicity together with unfathomable persistence is enough to reach any objective.

Anyways, here are the quotes:

##### Quotes

* “Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance.” - Coco Chanel

* “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” - Leonardo da Vinci

* *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” - Albert Einstein*

* “Don’t make the process harder than it is.” - Jack Welch

* “The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.” - Hans Hofmann

* “The greatest ideas are the simplest.” - William Golding

* “The core of beauty is simplicity” - Paulo Coelho

* “I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best.” - Oscar Wilde

* “It is the essence of genius to make use of the simplest ideas.” - Charles Péguy

* “Three rules of work: out of clutter find simplicity. From discord find harmony. In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.” - Albert Einstein

I really enjoy the highlighted one from Einstein. There indeed is a point where too much simplicity leads to inefficiency. However, if you can go simpler without affecting your performance, it'll surely pay off.
