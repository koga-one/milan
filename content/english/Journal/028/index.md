***#028***

Ah! The beauty of ignorance.

Today I had the pleasure of having my work discussed with a person that definitely didn't understand what the f*ck they were talking about.

Anyways, here is another post from my startup Dupla.

    {{< imgproc path="images/ig.png" method="Fit" size="500x500" col="12" >}}
</div>
