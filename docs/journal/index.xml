Oops, I mistook the numbers. Well, this one is the actual 007. Anyways, here is the drawing for today. I promise I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find more time to write other stuff here in this website. It&amp;rsquo;s just that&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m so busy recently, and my routine is so sh*t right now

      <description>Another day, another drawing. Today I finally woke up at the right time! Unfortunately this drawing didn&amp;rsquo;t reach my expectations, but hey&amp;hellip; I draw everyday! Some of the drawings won&amp;rsquo;t be that good, it&amp;rsquo;s alright. All that matters is that I keep going

Holy crap! Just finished this drawing. It is very encouraging when you look back and notice you&amp;rsquo;re improving! Also, I&amp;rsquo;m changing my routine by applying a new system that I called &amp;ldquo;The Fours&amp;rdquo;. It will help me have more time to write as well, so perhaps this website will get more active ;)

Ahhh! Nothing beats a good exercise routine to boost the energy. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually post some other content here, otherwise this website will be just a lame diary. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very interesting, honestly. I&amp;rsquo;ve just been very lazy recently, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry!</description>

I DON&amp;rsquo;T KNOW WHY, but I have no trouble drawing traditionally. When it comes to digital art, however, I just&amp;hellip; can&amp;rsquo;t. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll transition from traditional daily sketches to digital daily sketches until I eventually get used to it. I reckon it&amp;rsquo;s all about practice</description>

From now on, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep up with my schedule and routine with the streak mindset! Getting to certain milestones will help make it more memorable. I&amp;rsquo;ll also define certain awards for myself hah.</description>
