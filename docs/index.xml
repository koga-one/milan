Ahhh! Nothing beats a good exercise routine to boost the energy. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually post some other content here, otherwise this website will be just a lame diary. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very interesting, honestly. I&amp;rsquo;ve just been very lazy recently, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry!</description>

I DON&amp;rsquo;T KNOW WHY, but I have no trouble drawing traditionally. When it comes to digital art, however, I just&amp;hellip; can&amp;rsquo;t. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll transition from traditional daily sketches to digital daily sketches until I eventually get used to it. I reckon it&amp;rsquo;s all about practice</description>
